For the attention of Edinarcoin (EDR) Crypto Currency Management.
BEWARE!!! IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING EDINARCOIN (EDR), PLEASE READ THIS PETITION BEFORE AND BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU PUT YOUR MONEY.
WE REQUEST TO EDINARCOIN MANAGEMENT TO REIMBURSE ALL THE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN FROM US. THERE ARE MORE THAN 60,000 OF US WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED ALL OVER THE WORLD AND MORE THAN 10 MILLION COINS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST.
We all started using Edinar by buying 1 Edinar for $1 on the https://e-dinar.io website and we were told that the coin would retain its internal value of $1 until its market release.
When the coin was put on the market on 26/08/2016, we still had all of our own coins on the https://e-dinar.io website until the morning of 30/08/2016 when we logged into our e-dinar.io accounts and all of our money had disappeared, all of our wallets were at "0" and  THE BALANCES HAD DISAPPEARED!!!
When we spoke to Anastasia (Edinarcoin Employee)
She told us that all of our money had been put into another wallet so that we could send it to the Edinarcoin blockchain wallet https://wallet.edinarcoin.com but suprisently, our balances had been severely reduced.  WITHOUT PRIOR WARNING NEITHER AUTHORISATION FROM ANY MEMBER OF EDINAR, Edinar management changed all of our coins to the value of $1,350.
As a consequence: people who had 1,350 Edinar, ended up with 1 Edinarcoin (EDR), and people who had 100 Edinar ended up with 0.0740 Edinarcoin (this DOESN’T even add up to 1 cent from a dollar)
SEE EDINARCOIN (EDR) LAUNCH DAY:  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/e-dinar-coin
Consequently we got in contact with Anastasia again (Edinarcoin Employee) and via a conference room, she publicly announced to 100 people:
NOT TO WORRY, the company had changed this figure to €1,350 but they would reimburse all of the coins 1 by 1 to everybody.
That we all had to open our wallets at https://wallet.edinarcoin.com to be able to retrieve the rest of the remaining Edinarcoin coins belonging to all of the members of the Edinar network.
<UP TO AND INCLUDING THE DATE OF THIS PETITION WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE REST OF THE EDINARCOIN COINS>
Only 70 people have received part of their coins and they told the rest of us that if we want to get our coins back, we have to bring more people to Edinarcoin and to buy coins from  Edinarcoin employees like Anastasia or Max. This is the only way we would get 5% back of our Edinarcoin coins.
<THEY BLACKMAILED US SAYING THAT IF WE DON’T BRING ANYONE TO THE BUSINESS, THEY WON’T REIMBURSE US WITH ANYTHING> 
We were told that the value of the Edinar would remain at $1 until its market realise, where its value would be determined according to the supply and demand, which we were in agreement with. But it changed over without any prior warning and without our authorisation and before signing out of our e-dinar.io website (that is they weren’t on the market), to the value of $1,350, taking our right to decide over our balances. So we consider this act to be prosecuted.
FOR ALL OF US EDINARCOIN IS AN ALLEGED GREAT FRAUD
In addition, those people who have realised upon this fact and are withdrawing their money are having their accounts (wallets) blocked by EDINARCOIN in order to prevent them from doing so, by blocking their money and the option to access it.
WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF PERMITTING THIS TYPE OF FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOUR!!! And companies like this can  get off scot-free WITHOUT ANY REGULATIONS
If you are a victim of EDINARCOIN and you want to report this fact to the authorities in Spain, you can do so by clicking on the following link:

Remember that if victims like you and I don’t report this suspected cyber fraud, these alleged companies will continue taking advantage of our innocence.
We sign this petition to request to Edinarcoin management to reimburse all of the Edinarcoin  to the people who put their trust into this project. The people who deposited their money and want to have it at their disposal. This is the reason why they put their trust in Edinarcoin. They were always told that there wouldn’t be any withdrawal limitations. But here we can see that this isn’t the case and that they have simply kept our money.
WE REQUEST TO EDINARCOIN MANAGEMENT TO REFUND ALL OF OUR MONEY TAKEN FROM US. THERE ARE MORE THAN 60,000 OF US WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED ALL OVER THE WORLD.
BEWARE!!! IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING EDINARCOIN (EDR) PLEASE READ THIS PETITION BEFORE AND BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU PUT YOUR MONEY.
